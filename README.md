    - When set to True, pieces are randomly chosen from the entire list of possible pieces each time.
    - When set to False, pieces are selected from a shuffled set of all possible piece types. Once the last piece is reached, the collection is shuffled again before the next selection.
- The "Next piece preview" toggle shows and hides the next piece preview (top right corner of the game screen).
- The "Animate line clear" toggle enables and disables the animation during line clear.
- The "Ghost piece" toggle enables and disables visibility of the [ghost piece](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ghost_piece) on the game board.
- The "Ghost piece style" toggle switches between showing the ghost piece using outlines of the blocks or using the filled blocks.
